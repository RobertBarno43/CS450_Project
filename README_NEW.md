# Real Estate Price Insights Dashboard

An interactive React dashboard that visualizes real estate data using D3.js charts. This project uses the Real Estate Price Insights dataset from Kaggle to display various insights about housing market trends and property characteristics.

## Features

- **Interactive Charts**: Four different chart types built with D3.js
  - Scatter Plot: Price vs Area colored by bedrooms
  - Bar Chart: Average price by number of bedrooms
  - Histogram: Price distribution across all properties
  - Donut Chart: Distribution by furnishing status

- **Data Filtering**: Filter data by:
  - Number of bedrooms (1-2, 3, or 4-5 bedrooms)
  - Price ranges (Under $7M, $7M-$10M, Above $10M)

- **Interactive Statistics**: Real-time statistics that update based on filters

- **Responsive Design**: Modern glassmorphism UI that works on different screen sizes

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Download and Process the Real Dataset

First, install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the data download script:

```bash
python download_data.py
```

This will:
- Download the latest Real Estate Price Insights dataset from Kaggle using kagglehub
- Process and clean the data
- Convert it to JavaScript format for use in the React app
- Save it as `src/realEstateData.js`

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

**Features**:
- `price`: Selling price of the house
- `area`: Total area (in square feet)
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `stories`: Total floors in the house
- `mainroad`: Whether the house is connected to the main road
- `guestroom`: Availability of a guest room

- `parking`: Number of parking spaces
- `prefarea`: If the house is in a preferred area
- `furnishingstatus`: Furnishing condition (furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.2.0
- **Visualization**: D3.js
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with glassmorphism design
- **Data Processing**: Python with pandas and kagglehub

## How to Use

1. **View All Charts**: The dashboard shows all visualizations by default
2. **Select Individual Charts**: Use the chart selector buttons to focus on specific visualizations
3. **Apply Filters**: Use the filter controls to explore specific segments of the data
4. **Hover for Details**: Hover over chart elements to see detailed tooltips
5. **Monitor Statistics**: Watch the statistics panel update as you apply filters

## Chart Descriptions

1. **Price vs Area Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between property area and price, with points colored by number of bedrooms. Hover over points to see detailed information.

2. **Average Price by Bedrooms Bar Chart**: Displays the average price for properties grouped by number of bedrooms. Shows how bedroom count affects property value.

3. **Price Distribution Histogram**: Shows the distribution of property prices across the dataset. Helps identify price ranges and market segments.

4. **Furnishing Status Donut Chart**: Visualizes the proportion of properties by furnishing status (furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished).
